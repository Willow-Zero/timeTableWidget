#TimeTableWidget

The idea of this project is to put together a way to display the timetables for transit services in an aesthetically pleasing manner, while also providing useful information. form factor inspired by a device a friend of mine has that i cannot for the life of me track down, but which does essentially this, as well as some other stuff that i wouldnt necessarily find as useful - though i may impliment some of these later, and turn this into a more general info widget. 

Currently utilizing [gtfs_realtime_json][def] to convert gtfs. because i cant figure out how to get arch to behave. im migrating to fedora soon so this shouldnt be along term situation
