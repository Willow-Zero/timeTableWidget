#TimeTableWidget
The idea of this project is to put together a way to display the timetables for transit services in an aesthetically pleasing manner, while also providing useful information. form factor inspired by a device a friend of mine has that i cannot for the life of me track down, but which does essentially this, as well as some other stuff that i wouldnt necessarily find as useful - though i may impliment some of these later, and turn this into a more general info widget.
