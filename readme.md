# TimeTableWidget

The idea of this project is to put together a way to display the timetables for transit services in an aesthetically pleasing manner, while also providing useful information. form factor inspired by a device a friend of mine has that i cannot for the life of me track down, but which does essentially this, as well as some other stuff that i wouldnt necessarily find as useful - though i may impliment some of these later, and turn this into a more general info widget. 

Currently in development. in its current state, gets data for the next 6 train going downtown from the Astor Place station in the Lower East Side of New York City, a station signifigant to my personal commute, but not to very many other things. current next steps are allowing further configuration, supporting other train systems, and rendering a visual aspecct to convey information more effectively, likely with a text-based interface for all of the above.
